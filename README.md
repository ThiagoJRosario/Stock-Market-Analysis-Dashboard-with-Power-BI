# Stock-Market-Analysis-Dashboard-with-Power-BI

In this mini-project, we use real, publicly available stock market data to build an analytical dashboard. The dataset includes stock data for five companies: IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Tesla, and Walmart, sourced from the Nasdaq portal.

This project introduces the concept of Time Intelligence in Power BI, which allows for simplified manipulation of time-series data, such as stock prices over time. We also leverage Power BI's Smart Narrative feature to automatically explain data trends and insights.

The dashboard is designed to address the following business questions:

What is the total trading volume over time for the five companies being analyzed? Allow this analysis to be filtered for one or multiple companies.
What are the average opening (Open), highest (High), lowest (Low), and closing (Close) stock prices for all companies across all months during the analyzed period (1 year)? Display this in a table and allow filtering by one or multiple companies.
What is the variation in the average closing price of the stocks over time, month by month? Allow this analysis to be filtered for one or multiple companies.
Use the Smart Narrative feature to automatically explain the key characteristics and trends in the data.
This project provides critical insights into stock price behavior over time, allowing investors and analysts to make informed decisions based on the historical performance of selected companies.

Data Source: Public stock data from Nasdaq.
